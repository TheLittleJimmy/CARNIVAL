## Obsolete code kept here for backward compatibility for v.2.1. Planned to be removed in v.3
## Functions to build internal data representation used in CARNIVAL v.1.2
## The code was refactored but has the same logic as in v.1.2. 
#TODO 
## Changes: ...

## Enio Gjerga, Olga Ivanova 2020-2021

## Return the data matrix containing the data for running CARNIVAL 
## and a set of identifiers for targets, measured and unmeasured nodes.

## Returns the identifiers of all the variables used in the ILP 
## formulation together with an explanation about each of them. 
## Full explanations:
# variables - list of all variables for ILP problem 
# exp - verbose explanation of each variable 
# idxNodes - indices of variables corresponding to nodes in full variables list
# idxNodesUp/idxNodesDown - indices of variables corresponding to nodes up/down-regulated in full variables list
# idxEdgesUp/idxEdgesDown - indices of variables corresponding to edges up/down-regulated in full variables list
# signs - signs of the edges provided in prior knowledge network
# reactionSource/reactionTarget - nodes names from prior knowledge network with an outgoing/incoming edge
# expNodesReduced - full list of nodes names in prior knowledge network
# expNodesReducedUpSource/expNodesReducedDownSource - source nodes names from prior knowledge network 
# expNodesReducedUpTarget/expNodesReducedDownTarget - target nodes names from prior knowledge network 
# expEdgesReducedSource/expEdgesReducedTarget - list of sources/targets from $exp with verbose explanation
# expNodesReducedUp/expNodesReducedDown - all nodes names 
# idxB - indices of variables corresponding to B variables (see constraint 8 in Liu et al.) in full variables list
# idxDist - indices of variables corresponding to distance variables in full variables list
# uTable - prior knowledge network nodes translated to variables. Column 1 - source nodes; column 2 - target nodes

# "Reduced" in variable names corresponded to measurements information combined with 
# prior knowledge network, where nodes that are not present in prior knowledge network were removed
# from the measurements data. Basically, it is always the same list of nodes as in PKN.
# See buildDataVector(...) dataVector for information.
